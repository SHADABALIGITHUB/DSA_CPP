cout cin  main function in cpp 

#includes and namespace 

how code run  code compile than executable file i.e. binary file or some say machine code 

run  you can use && for running both at once 

# variable  

 age store anything just specify using data type 

 c++ is statically typed language

 primitive 

 int 4 byte  -> char 1 byte  -> float 4/8 byte  -> double 8 byte  -> bool 1 byte 

 # typecating  #conversion 
 conversion automatically done 
 typecasting we have to say explicity to convert and data also lost int this like double 23.45 into int we lose .45

 # operators 
 arithematic logical relational uniary
